    <h2>About Trickle Cash</h2>
    <p>Trickle Cash is a continuous budget tracking app that helps you manage your money more effectively. Instead of thinking about your budget in fixed monthly amounts, Trickle Cash shows you a "virtual wallet" that fills up gradually throughout the month.</p>

    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Continuous Budget:</strong> Enter your monthly budget and watch your virtual wallet grow in real-time</li>
        <li><strong>Expense Tracking:</strong> Easily record your spending, which is automatically deducted from your virtual wallet</li>
        <li><strong>Savings Buckets:</strong> Create dedicated savings buckets for future purchases or goals</li>
    </ul>
